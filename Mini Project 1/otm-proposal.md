# Off-the-menu project proposal

You can design your own "off-the-menu" projects to demonstrate your skills in a way that's more tailored to your interests and career goals. OtM projects require a proposal to ensure they're feasible and useful.

## Instructions

The goal of submitting a proposal isn't to impress me. I just want to be confident that this undertaking will be 1) doable and 2) useful. 

1. Create a new subdirectory for your proposed mini-project and create a copy of this file in that directory.
2. In that new file in the correct subdirectory, answer the prompts below.
3. On Canvas, go to your next open mini-project assignment and submit a link to this proposal document, which will alert Dr. Dowling to review your proposal. 
4. If your assignment "complete" grade, you're good to go! If you receive an "incomplete," you'll also get feedback on what needs to be changed before you can proceed. You can then resubmit the proposal to the same assignment on Canvas after making the necessary changes.

## Proposal prompts

1.  **Project description:**
    - Write 1-2 paragraphs/bullet points here describing the project
2.  **Learning objectives:**
    - Either list at least 3 learning objectives or provide a simple description of what off-the-syllabus skills you would like to practice
3.  **Motivation:**
    - Write a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) here for why you want to take on this project.
4. **Submission format:**
    - Describe what the final product of your project will look like. Will it be a dedicated repo? A directory in this centralized repo? A website? A URL? An interpretive dance performance?
5. **Additional comments:**
    - If there is anything else you think I should know, please let me know here.


## OtM mini-project submission instructions

1. In your mini-project's subdirectory, create a new file called `README.md` that includes a brief description of what you set out to do, what you ended up doing, and anything else you'd like your grader to know.
2. Create a copy of the assessment.md file and complete it as you would for any other mini-project.
3. Go the the same Canvas assignment where you submitted your proposal and submit a link to your mini-project's subdirectory (as a "resubmission").
