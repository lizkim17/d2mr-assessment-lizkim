# Off-the-menu project proposal

You can design your own "off-the-menu" projects to demonstrate your skills in a way that's more tailored to your interests and career goals. OtM projects require a proposal to ensure they're feasible and useful.

## Instructions

The goal of submitting a proposal isn't to impress me. I just want to be confident that this undertaking will be 1) doable and 2) useful. 

1. Create a new subdirectory for your proposed mini-project and create a copy of this file in that directory.
2. In that new file in the correct subdirectory, answer the prompts below.
3. On Canvas, go to your next open mini-project assignment and submit a link to this proposal document, which will alert Dr. Dowling to review your proposal. 
4. If your assignment "complete" grade, you're good to go! If you receive an "incomplete," you'll also get feedback on what needs to be changed before you can proceed. You can then resubmit the proposal to the same assignment on Canvas after making the necessary changes.

## Proposal prompts

Name: Liz Kim
Section: 1
Project title: Happiness Level and GDP & Life Expectancy
Date: 1/18/2025

1.  **Project description:**
I want to create my own mini research for the first mini project. I want to investigates the factors associated with national happiness, utilizing happiness scores from the World Population Review and key factors from Wikipedia tables. Two variables I will explore include GDP per capita and life expectancy, offering insights into the economic and health-related factors that influence happiness levels across countries.

2.  **Learning objectives:**

I will include 17 learning objectives, four unassessed objectives, and two off the menu objective, which will ideally give me 23 points for this project. Below is the list of objectives I am using for this mini project.

Github and RStudio:

create and maintain a repo with sensible organization and naming conventions
maintain an informative and up-to-date README.md
integrate a GitHub repo with an R studio project, including .gitignore file
effectively use version control

R Programming:

find, install, require, and load R packages
parse and define functions and arguments
parse and write conditional statements

Tidyverse 

9. use readr functions to read in and write out data 10. use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data

ggplopt2 

13. produce 1- and 2-variable plots with geom_* layers 14.use dynamic aesthetics to group data 16. create publication-quality plots using theme and labs layers

Data Analysis 

17. perform simple descriptive analyses for numeric and factor data (e.g., mean, standard deviation, frequency tables) 19. present and interpret statistics in manuscript narrative

Code chunks 

23. create and effectively use code chunks following best practices informative names informative comments 1-chunk-1-thing rule distributed throughout the manuscript chunk options 25. render publication-quality, captioned tables, figures, and images in code chunks

R Markdwon 

28. use Quarto/R Markdown (e.g., headers, text style, lists, etc.) to compose an academic manuscript

Unassessed Learning Objectives:

use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown
define “tidy” data and explain its advantages and disadvantages
recognize and interpret common data visualizations
determine most appropriate visualizations and analyses for specific research questions and data

Off the Menu:

scrape data from external sources
create a table of contents with links to each heading

3.  **Motivation:**
I want to take on this project because instead of working on multiple small projects, I want to practice writing a report based on a research question that I am asking. I want to practice scraping data from external sources, tidying the data, using fuctions/conditional statements, and finally visualizations along with the interpretation.

4. **Submission format:**
The folder "Mini Project1" under d2mr-assessment-lizkim will contain all necessary files.

5. **Additional comments:**
None.


## OtM mini-project submission instructions

1. In your mini-project's subdirectory, create a new file called `README.md` that includes a brief description of what you set out to do, what you ended up doing, and anything else you'd like your grader to know.
2. Create a copy of the assessment.md file and complete it as you would for any other mini-project.
3. Go the the same Canvas assignment where you submitted your proposal and submit a link to your mini-project's subdirectory (as a "resubmission").
