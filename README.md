## Project description

I want to create my own mini research for the first mini project. I want to investigates the factors associated with national happiness, utilizing happiness scores from the World Population Review and key factors from Wikipedia tables. Two variables I will explore include GDP per capita and life expectancy, offering insights into the economic, environmental, educational, and health-related factors that influence happiness levels across countries.

## Learning objectives

I will include 17 learning objectives and four unassessed objectives which will ideally give me 21 points for this project. Below is the list of objectives I am using for this mini project.  

Github and RStudio:

1. create and maintain a repo with sensible organization and naming conventions
2. maintain an informative and up-to-date README.md
3. integrate a GitHub repo with an R studio project, including .gitignore file
4. effectively use version control

R Programming
1. find, install, require, and load R packages
7. parse and define functions and arguments
8. parse and write conditional statements

Tidyverse
9. use readr functions to read in and write out data
10. use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data

ggplopt2
13. produce 1- and 2-variable plots with geom_* layers
14.use dynamic aesthetics to group data
16. create publication-quality plots using theme and labs layers

Data Analysis
17. perform simple descriptive analyses for numeric and factor data (e.g., mean, standard deviation, frequency tables)
19. present and interpret statistics in manuscript narrative

Code chunks
23. create and effectively use code chunks following best practices informative names informative comments 1-chunk-1-thing rule distributed throughout the manuscript chunk options
25. render publication-quality, captioned tables, figures, and images in code chunks

R Markdwon
28. use Quarto/R Markdown (e.g., headers, text style, lists, etc.) to compose an academic manuscript

Unassessed Learning Objectives: 
1. use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown
14. define “tidy” data and explain its advantages and disadvantages
15. recognize and interpret common data visualizations
16. determine most appropriate visualizations and analyses for specific research questions and data
  
## Why this Project? 

I want to take on this project because instead of working on multiple small projects, I want to practice writing a report based on a research question that I am asking. I want to practice scraping data from external sources, tidying the data, using fuctions/conditional statements, and finally visualizations along with the interpretation.

## Submission format

I will submit a link of a new repo. This repo will include a one README file, an rmd file, a word document, and necessary files and plots.
