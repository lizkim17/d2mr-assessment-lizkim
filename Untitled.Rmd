## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Save the URL and scrape the webpage
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita"
gdp_page <- read_html(x = url)

# Extract all tables with the class "wikitable"
tables <- html_elements(gdp_page, css = "table.wikitable")

# Convert the first table to a data frame
gdp_per_capita_table <- html_table(tables[[1]], fill = TRUE)

# Save the table as a CSV file
write_csv(gdp_per_capita_table, "gdp_per_capita.csv")

# Preview the table
head(gdp_per_capita_table)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
